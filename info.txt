Here is my submission for the programming challenge
It was completed in 3 hours and 30 minutes
If I had more time, I would improve the hard mode setting to analyze a few moves ahead instead of just one
I would also improve the gui - make sure it is usable on many different screen sizes, make the buttons look better, etc
I added notes to assist an outside reader to understand what is going on
To calculate if someone won faster, every X is given a value of 1, and every O is given a value of 4. Thus the sums of 3 and 12 can only be achieved by 3 in a row
